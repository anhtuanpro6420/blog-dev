## **What is algorithm?**

Basically, whenever we want to solve a problem we will need a set of steps to follow to solve that problem. These steps are called algorithms.

Example: Given an integer array, let's sort them in ascending order. 

There will be many algorithms to solve this problem: QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, BubbleSort, InsertionSort,...

I will go into detail for each algorithm in the next articles.

The results of these algorithms will be the same but the performance of each algorithm will be different. 

So how do we know which algorithm is performing better, which one runs faster, which one uses less memory space?

## **Big-O notation?**

Big-O is a mathematical symbol that shows the efficiency of an algorithm in the worst-case. To measure the efficiency of an algorithm, we need to consider two things:

* **Time Complexity (TC):** quantifies the amount of timetaken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input
* **Space Complexity (SC):** quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

In some cases we will have to trade, either increase SC for faster or smaller SC but slower.

## **Time complexity?**

So, how to denote Time Complexity via Big-O? How to calculate Time Complexity?

```javascript
// O(1)
funtion hello() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}
```

In above code 'Hello World!' print only once. So, time complexity is constant: O(1).

But this function bellow print n times, depending on the length of the input array. So, the time complexity is linear time O(n) or quadratic time O(n^2).

```javascript
// O(n)
function printArr(arr) {
  for (let i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
  }
}
```

```javascript
// O(n^2)
function sortArr(arr) {
  for (let i=0; i<arr.length-1; i++) {
    for (let j=i+1; j<arr.length; j++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
            let temp = arr[j];
            arr[j] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
    }
  }
}

```



Hereâ€™s a list of Big-O complexities sorted in ascending order:

Here is a the Big O time complexity chart to see where your algorithm lies in terms of efficiency:
